# Memories
This is a tutorial I found on youtube. My goal with this is to get a quick review on starting off a project using the MERN stack, so I can convert a current Rails/React to Node/React. 

This tutorial also uses Material UI and utilizes a folder structure meant for medium and large scale applications. Seeing the change in folder organization is enlightening and I look forward to applying what I am learning to next app I build.
